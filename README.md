Guess the color (game): https://zoltanmathias.github.io/guess-the-color/

A simple game where you get to try and pick the correct color based on a rgb value!

The rgb values are randomly generated with the use of JavaScript. The colors then appear in a grid and become all the same color once the right color has been picked.

The game has two difficulty settings (One with 3 colors, other with 6 colors).
When an incorrect color is clicked, it fades and narrows down the user's choices.

This game was heavily influenced by Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy.
